In this repository, the code of my master thesis may be found.

The following files are present:
- NER: Named Entity Recognition for the European stocks
- NERUS: Named Entity Recognition for the U.S. stocks
- EventEURMM: Event study for the European stocks, using the market model
- EventEURFF: Event study for the European stocks, using the Fama-French model
- EventUSMM: Event study for the U.S. stocks, using the market model
- EventUSFF: Event study for the U.S. stocks, using the Fama-French model

It should be self-explanatory.
